Nice Annotation Interface for text

Nathan Schneider (nschneid@cs.cmu.edu)

Status: IN DEVELOPMENT


# Goals

 * modular specification of multiple forms of annotation
 * multiple users (annotators)
 * short items (e.g. sentences)
 * everything stored in text files
 * written in Javascript and PHP
 * works in Firefox

# Preliminary

 * annotation persistence (for an item and user); not yet supported for (preposition) tags

# Upcoming features

 * viewing previous annotations of an item
 * viewing multiple previous annotations side-by-side
 * compound users for consensus
 * flexible item navigation

# Possible features

 * searching of items/annotations
 * user groups
 * annotation queues (data with minimum/maximum number of annotations per item)
